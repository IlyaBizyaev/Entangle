## Description
**Entangle** is a simple application, designed to help users protect their private data in a few clicks using AES encryption.  
It can also be used to make backups, as it supports ZIP compression.  
**Entangle** is built using wxWidgets and Crypto++ libraries, which makes it cross-platform.
### Features:
- User-friendly
- Multilingual
- Cross-platform
- Lightweight
- Two modes: GUI and console

## Building from sources
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IlyaBizyaev/Entangle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IlyaBizyaev/Entangle)
### Linux
To build the application on Linux, you need to install the following packages:
- `libwxgtk3.0` and `libwxgtk3.0-dev` for wxWidgets
- `libcrypto++9` and `libcrypto++-dev` for Crypto++  
It is also possible to use manually built libraries.

**Note.** On some distributions, Cryto++ packages may be called `libcryptopp`.

### Windows
On Windows, you have to download wxWidgets and Crypto++ libraries from official websites and build them manually.
**Notes:**  
For wxWidgets, it is recommended to use MSYS and run `make install`.  
For Crypto++, it is recommended to locate it at `C:\cryptopp`.  
You may have to edit the Makefile otherwise.

**Supported compilers:** GCC (TDM-GCC on Windows).

### Compilation
```
cd ~/Entangle/ # Depends on the location
make
sudo make install
make clean
```
