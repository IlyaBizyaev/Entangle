# Entangle
## Description
Entangle is a simple application, designed to help users protect their private and personal data in a few clicks.
Entangle is built using wxWidgets and Crypto++ libraries, which makes it cross-platform.
Entangle is distributed under GNU GPL v3; however, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO make forks or use this code in any other applications until first official release 
## NOTE
For now, this application is under active development, so, the "master" branch is empty; however, you can see the pre-release code in the "unstable" branch.
